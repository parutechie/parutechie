    summary: "Software Developer by profession, AI babysitter by experience. I build scalable systems, design APIs, wrangle databases, and let machine intelligence handle the boring stuff. I create software that behaves, scales, and occasionally acts like it has a mind of its own—because why not let the code have fun too?"
